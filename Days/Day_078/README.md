**Blood Donation Management System** 


**Project Objective:** 
The blood donation system is an SQL project where the patient's particulars, blood bank and the donor's data are saved in the database with their inter-relations. The various operations of the blood bank include the collection, preservation and blood donations to patients. 

**Project Tasks:**
The blood donation system is an SQL project where the patient's particulars, blood bank and the donor's data are saved in the database with their inter-relations. The various operations of the blood bank include the collection, preservation and blood donations to patients.    

Users can create a blood donation system with the following features:   

a) Patient data: Name, ID, Blood group and disease   

b) Donor data: Name and Donor ID, blood group, medical reports and contact details   

c) Blood bank data: Name and address  

Users can design their system to help maintain the patient's blood banks, including the quality of the maintained blood records. The blood bank record must be immediately available when the patient requests it. This project is highly recommended if the users are looking for SQL projects to practice their skills.    

Users can create a database to store and manage the blood donation details about the blood donors, such as their name, age, blood group and so on. This information is recorded with the recipients' details like their name, age, blood group, etc. This will help the many hospitals that need blood from the blood bank. Most importantly, the database should contain details about the quality of blood, such as if it is contaminated, and so on.    

Users can use the dataset to solve a few key questions, such as:   

a) Is there adequate blood available in the blood bank?   

b) Does the have any current or a history of blood-borne diseases?
